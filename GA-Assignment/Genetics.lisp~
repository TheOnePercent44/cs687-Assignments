;;; Project 1: Build a simple evolutionary computation system.

;;; This is a nontrivial project to start with.  Do not discuss
;;; programming issues related to this project with other groups.
;;; If you have questions, contact me directly.  You may post to
;;; the Wiki questions of a general nature that you'd like people
;;; to respond to.

;;; Unquestionably the hardest code is the GP crossover operator and
;;; the PTC2 code.  For information about the Symbolic Regression
;;; and Artificial Ant problems, I have posted some chunks of my
;;; thesis to the web page to peruse.

;;; Please don't deviate much from this file -- I'm just looking for
;;; you to fill out these functions below and maybe add a bit more.  Rearranging
;;; things into multiple files etc. may be convenient for you but it's MUCH
;;; tougher to grade.

In this project you will produce three things:

1. A high-level evolutionary computation framework

2. The representation, breeding functions, and evaluations to do a simple
GA for boolean vectors and for floating-point vectors, including a few test
functions on each.

3. The representation, breeding functions, and evaluations to do GP for
two problems:
A. Symbolic Regression
B. Artificial Ant

The high-level EC system will work as follows:

- Simple generational evolution
- GA-style Tournament selection
- A simple breeding function
- some simple statistics functions

I have provided the approximate function templates I myself used to complete
the task; with permission you can use these or go your own way, but otherwise
please try not to deviate much from this template.

The project is due approximately two and a half weeks from now or so.  Please 
try to get it in on time.

WHAT YOU MUST PROVIDE:

1. Completed code which works and compiles.  As simple as possible would be nice.

2. A short report describing the code you wrote and some experimentation with it.
Some things to try:
   -- different problems (in the vector section)
   -- different settings of mutation and crossover parameters
   -- different population sizes or run lengths
Try to get a handle on how problem difficulty changes when you tweak various
parameters.  Can you get mutation and crossover parameters which seem optimal for
a given problem for example?  (Obviously bigger population sizes are more optimal
but that's kinda cheating).  Note that this is a STOCHASTIC problem so you'll need
to run a number of times and get the mean best result in order to say anything of
consequence.  It'd be nice if the report were in LaTeX and it'd be good practice for
you as well, but it's not necessary.  I do not accept reports in Word.  Only send
me a PDF.

Make sure your code is compiled.  In most cases (such as SBCL), your code will be
automatically compiled.  But there exist systems (like LispWorks ("lisp" on 
mason.gmu.edu)) where the default is to interpret the code, and so you must 
compile your file first and then load that.

Information on compiling code and doing compiler optimizations can be found in the
"Speed" chapter of Graham.

  The simple version of PTC2 you will implement is as follows:

  PTC2(size):
  if size = 1, return a random terminal
  else
     q <- make-queue
     root <- random nonterminal
     count <- 1
     enqueue into q each child argument slot of root
     Loop until count + size_of_q >= size
        remove a random argument slot s from q
        a <- random nonterminal
        count <- count + 1
        fill the slot s with a
        enqueue into q each child argument slot of a
     Loop until size_of_q = 0
        remove a random argument slot s from q
        a <- random terminal
        fill the slot s with a
     return root


  Note that "terminals" will all be considered to be
  zero-argument functions.  Thus PTC might generate the
  s-expression tree:

  (cos (+ (x) (- (x) (x)) (sin (x))))

  but it should NOT generate the tree:

  (cos (+ x (- x x) (sin x)))


  Note that this has some gotchas: the big gotcha is that you have to keep track of
  argument slots in lisp s-expressions, and not just pointers to the values presently
  in those slots.  If you are totally lost as to how to implement that, I can provide
  some hints, but you should try to figure it out on your own if you can.

;;; SYMBOLIC REGRESSION
;;; This problem domain is similar, more or less, to the GP example in
;;; the lecture notes.  Your goal is to make a symbolic expression which
;;; represents a mathematical function consisting of SIN COS, EXP,
;;; +, -, *, and % (a version of / which doesn't give an error on
;;; divide-by-zero).  And also the function X, which returns a current
;;; value for the X variable.
;;;
;;; In symbolic regression, we generate 20 (x,y) pairs produced at
;;; random which fit the expression y = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x.  You can
;;; make up another function is you like, but that's the one we're going
;;; with here.  Using just these data pairs, the GP system will attempt
;;; to ascertain the function.  It will generate possible expressions
;;; as its individuals, and the fitness of an expression is how closely,
;;; for each X value, it gives the correct corresponding Y value.
;;;
;;; This is called SYMBOLIC regression because we're actually learning
;;; the mathematical expression itself, including transcendental functions
;;; like SIN and COS and E^.  As opposed to statistical linear or
;;; quadratic curve-fitting regressions which just try to learn the
;;; linear or quadratic parameters etc.
;;;
;;; An example 100% optimal solution:
;;;
;;; (+ (* (x) (* (+ (x) (* (x) (x))) (x))) (* (+ (x) (cos (- (x) (x)))) (x)))

;;; GP ARTIFICIAL ANT CODE
;;; for this part you'll need to implement both the evaluator AND
;;; make up the function that form the function set.

;;; In the artificial ant problem domain, you'll be evolving an s-expression
;;; which moves an ant around a toroidal map shown below.  The ant starts out
;;; at (0,0), facing east (to the right).  The functions in
;;; the expression are:
;;; (if-food-ahead --then-- --else--)   If food is directly ahead of the ant,
;;;                                     then evaluate the THEN expression, else
;;;                                     evaluate the ELSE expression
;;; (progn2 --item1-- --item2--)        Evaluate item1, then evaluate item 2
;;; (progn3 --item1-- --item2-- --item3--)  Evaluate item1, then item2, then item3
;;; (move)                              Move forward one unit
;;;                                     If you pass over a food pellet, it is eaten
;;;                                     and removed from the map.
;;; (left)                              Turn left
;;; (right)                             Turn right
;;;
;;;
;;; the way a tree is evaluated is as follows.  The whole tree is evaluated,
;;; and the functions move the ant about.  If the ant has not made a total of
;;; 600 MOVE, LEFT, and RIGHT operations yet, then the tree is evaluated AGAIN
;;; moving the ant some more from its current position.  This goes on until
;;; 600 operations have been completed, at which time the ant will not move
;;; any more.  If 600 operations are completed in the middle of the evaluation
;;; of a tree, the simplest approach is to have the MOVE command simply
;;; "stop working" so the ant doesn't gobble up any more pellets accidentally.

;;; The fitness of the artificial ant is the number of pellets it ate in the
;;; 600-operation period.  Maps are reset between evaluations of different
;;; individuals of course.

;;; Here's an optimal ant program (there are many such):
;;  (progn3 (if-food-ahead (move) (progn2 (left) (progn2 (left)
;;             (if-food-ahead (move) (right))))) (move) (right)))

;;; This is a hard problem for GP and you may need to run many times before you
;;; get a 100% perfect answer.

;;; Note that in my thesis it says 400 moves and not 600.  We're going with
;;; 600 here.  It's easier.
