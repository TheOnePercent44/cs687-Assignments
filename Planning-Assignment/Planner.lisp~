;;;;;;;; SIMPLE-PLAN
;;;;;;;; The following planner is a brute-force planning partial-order (POP) system.  
;;;;;;;; It doesn't use a heuristic, but instead just uses iterative-deepening search.  
;;;;;;;; If you want to see a high-quality, free POP planner, check out UCPOP at
;;;;;;;; https://www.cs.washington.edu/ai/ucpop.html
;;;;;;;; Note that there are many better planners still at this point (POP is getting old).
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;; The following planner does not use variables -- it's propositional and not
;;;;;;;; predicate-logic based.  Because it doesn't use
;;;;;;;; variables, we have to write more code to describe a problem (see the Blocks World
;;;;;;;; example at end) but it is a much easier algorithm to for you to write (you don't have to
;;;;;;;; be involved in unification.  Happy!).  
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;; I am giving you some basic code which defines predicates, links,
;;;;;;;; orderings, and strips operators and plans.  Then I'm giving you
;;;;;;;; the entry code which creates a minimal plan.  Lastly, you get a
;;;;;;;; simple two-block blocks world problem to play with, plus a three-
;;;;;;;; block blocks world problem to play with after you get the two-blocks
;;;;;;;; version working properly.
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;; SOME HINTS:
;;;;;;;; 1. Read up on DOTTED PAIRS
;;;;;;;; 2. Read up on ASSOCIATION LISTS
;;;;;;;; 3. Read up on STRUCTURES
;;;;;;;; 4. Read up on RETURN-FROM, RETURN, CATCH, and THROW
;;;;;;;; 5. MAPC and other mapping functions might be useful to you.
;;;;;;;; 6. So might HASH TABLES
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;; This is a tough assignment.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
;;;;;;;; If you get really stuck, I might be willing to "release" a function or two
;;;;;;;; to you, but at a cost in project grade of course.  Still, it'd be better than
;;;;;;;; not getting the project running.
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;; The big challenge in this project is getting the code running fast.  The class
;;;;;;;; will likely have a *huge* variance in running speed.  I can implement this code
;;;;;;;; to run very fast indeed, just a few milliseconds, so if your code is taking
;;;;;;;; many seconds to run, it's time to think about optimization and algorithmic
;;;;;;;; improvements.  
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;; Once you get the code working you might then think about how to implement some
;;;;;;;; other problems.  Check out ones in the book and think about how to propositionalize
;;;;;;;; them.  Or invent some fun problems.  You'll discover quickly that variables help
;;;;;;;; a lot!  A fun project might be to write a bit of code which converts a variable-style
;;;;;;;; problems to propositionalized ones so you don't have to write a million operators.
;;;;;;;; Or you might test how the system scales with more complex problems.  At any rate,
;;;;;;;; do some interesting extension of it.
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;; Provide the code for the project and a report as usual describing what you did and
;;;;;;;; what extensions or experiments you performed.  Please do not deviate far from the
;;;;;;;; code proper -- it's hard to grade otherwise.


;;;;; PREDICATES

;;; A predicate is a list of the form (t-or-nil name)
;;; where the t-or-nil indicates if it's negated,
;;; and NAME is a symbol indicating the predicate name.
;;; Example: (NIL B-ON-A)  "B is not on A"

(defun negate (predicate)
  "Negates a predicate.  Pretty simple!"
  (cons (not (first predicate)) (rest predicate)))


;;;;;; STRIPS OPERATORS
;;;;;; A strips operator has is described below.  Note that
;;;;;; UNIQ allows two operators with the same name, preconds
;;;;;; and effects to be in the plan at once.

(defstruct operator
   "Defines a strips operator consisting of
a NAME (a symbol or string),
a UNIQ gensym symbol assigned when the operator is added to the plan,
a list of PRECONDITIONS (predicates)

The resultant function MAKE-OPERATOR creates a *template*,
which is different from an instantiated operator actually in a plan.
Use instantiate-operator to create an operator from a template."

  ;; I suggest you use this code to guarantee that the operator is properly

  (let ((op (copy-structure operator)))
    (setf (operator-uniq op) (gensym))
    op))



;;;;;;; LINKS
;;;;;;; A link is a structure that specifies a causal link with a from-operator,
;;;;;;; a to-operator, and precondition of the to-operator involved
;;;;;;; (which is the SAME as the effect of the from-operator!)

(defstruct (link

		  (when (link-to p) (operator-name (link-to p)))
		    (link-precond p)))


;;;;;;; ORDERINGS
;;;;;;; An ordering is just a dotted pair of the form (before-op . after-op)
;;;;;;; where before-op and after-op are strips operators (instances of
;;;;;;; the OPERATOR structure).  The ordering specifies
;;;;;;; that before-op must come before after-op.

;;;;;;;;; UTILITY FUNCTIONS
;;;;;;;;; I predict you will find these functions useful.

;;;; Reachable takes an association list and determines if you can reach
;;;; an item in the list from another item.  For example:
;;;;
;;;; (reachable '((a . b) (c . d) (b . c) (b . e) (e . a)) 'e 'd)
;;;; --> T   ;; e->a, a->b, b->c, c->d

(defun reachable (assoc-list from to)
  "Returns t if to is reachable from from in the association list."
  ;; expensive!

;;; SPEED HINT.  You might rewrite this function to be more efficient.
;;; You could try dividing the list into two lists, one consisting of association pairs
;;; known to be reachable from FROM and ones not know to be reachable, then
;;; using the property of transitivity, move pairs from the second list to the first
;;; list, until either you discover it's reachable, or nothing else is moving.

  (dolist (x assoc-list nil)
    (when (and (equalp (car x) from)
	              (or (equalp (cdr x) to)
			     (reachable (remove x assoc-list) (cdr x) to)))
      (return t))))


;;;; Cyclic-assoc-list takes an association list and determines if it
;;;; contains a cycle (two objects can reach each other)
;;;;
;;;; (cyclic-assoc-list '((a . b) (c . d) (b . c) (b . e) (e . a)))
;;;; --> T   ;; a->b, b->e, e->a
;;;;

;;;;;; PLANNING CODE TEMPLATES
;;;;;;
;;;;;; The following are the functions I used to implement my planner.
;;;;;; You have been given all interfaces I used, but no implementation.
;;;;;; This is how I went about doing it -- if you want to you can of course
;;;;;; do the code differently, but indicate that you are doing so.
;;;;;;
;;;;;; The recursion looks like this:
;;;;;; SELECT-SUBGOAL calls CHOOSE-OPERATOR, which calls HOOK-UP-OPERATOR,
;;;;;; which calls RESOLVE-THREATS, which in turn calls SELECT-SUBGOAL.
;;;;;; All of these functions return a either plan
;;;;;; (the solution) or NIL (failure to find a solution).
;;;;;; 
;;;;;; In SELECT-SUBGOAL I test to see if the maximum depth is exceeded
;;;;;; and fail immediately if it is.  That's the only place I check for
;;;;;; depth.  You are free to test other places if you want.  Then I
;;;;;; I increment the current depth before passing it to CHOOSE-OPERATOR.
;;;;;;
;;;;;; Some hints: I also used PUSH and SETF and DOLIST a lot,
;;;;;; as well as a healthy dose of MAPCAR, MAPC, and MAPL.  Also you might
;;;;;; want to read up on CONSes of the form (a . b) which I use a lot,
;;;;;; and also ASSOCIATION LISTS which are very convenient in certain spots
